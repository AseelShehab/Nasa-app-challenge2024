-Chronicles of Exoplanet Exploration

# High-Level Summary
-The TERA Space is an innovative educational device designed specifically to provide a unique interactive experience in the world of exoplanets. The device is based on the story of a NASA astronaut who sets off on a journey to test a modern spacecraft, accompanied by an artificial intelligence robot called "Vega". They get into an accident that leads to them being lost in an exoplanetary system, allowing the device to provide an interactive and immersive educational experience. Tera Space includes games, videos, and resources that expose users to unique and fun challenges that enhance decision-making skills and increase their knowledge of planets, stars, and outer orbits. It also makes it able to simulate what real astronauts experience, enhances user knowledge and provides them with educational resources.

# Use of Artificial Intelligence
-We manually drew a model of the shape of the device that we designed, “TERA Space,” and then we asked ChatGPT to draw a similar model. https://chatgpt.com
